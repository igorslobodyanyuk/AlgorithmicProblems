        // 1.5 One Away: You can insert/remove/replace one character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit away.
        
        // 1.6 String Compression: implement a method to perform a basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
        // Example: aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3
        // If the compressed string is not smaller than the original, return original
        
        // 1.7 Rotate Matrix: given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel is an int, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
        // Can you do it in place?
        
        // 1.8 Zero Matrix: write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
        
        // 1.9 String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one work is a substring of another.
        // Given two strings check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring
        // Example: 'waterbottle' is a rotation of 'erbottlewat'
